# Big-Ideas--Group-project

This Python program asks for your name and your favorite color. Then it matches your color to a fruit and shows a message.

For example:

Red → Apple

Yellow → Banana

Green → Kiwi

Purple → Grape

Orange → Orange

If the color isn’t on the list, it says it doesn’t know a fruit for that color. Finally, it prints a message like:

“Hey Mina! Your favorite color ‘red’ reminds me of an apple.”
